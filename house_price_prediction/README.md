Work from the Kaggle competition ["House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques:"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)

[general_analysis](https://github.com/amjcosta/Kaggle/blob/master/house_price_prediction/general_analysis.ipynb) is the notebook containing visualization and general exploration. This is probably the one you want to read.

[housing_price_prediction_exploration](https://github.com/amjcosta/Kaggle/blob/master/house_price_prediction/housing_price_prediction_exploration.ipynb) is where I first began to formulate my thoughts and explore the data.
[housing_price_analysis_stats](https://github.com/amjcosta/Kaggle/blob/master/house_price_prediction/housing_price_analysis_stats.ipynb) is where I pretend I'm an economics student again, investigating the linear model.
[housing_price_modeling](https://github.com/amjcosta/Kaggle/blob/master/house_price_prediction/housing_price_modeling.ipynb) is the notebook I used to train a linear model and output predictions for Kaggle.
